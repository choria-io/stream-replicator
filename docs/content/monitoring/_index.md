## Message Source Information

Every message that gets copied has a header added called `Choria-SR-Source` with an example being `CHORIA_REGISTRATION 10631 US-EAST-1 PARTITION1 1673433286805`.
Using this you can determine where any copied message is from, which worker copied it and the delay between the message creation, and it's arriving in the target.

From this we know the following:

 * The source stream is called `CHORIA_REGISTRATION`
 * The message we are looking at has a Stream Sequence of `10631` in the source stream
 * The replicator name (configured using top level `name` in the config file) is `US-EAST-1`
 * The `name` set on the `stream` configuration is `PARTITION1` this allows you to tell which specific copier config copied it, helping to identify ordering or partition logic issues
 * The message was stored in the source at `1673433286805` which is a milliseconds since Unix epoch. Delta between this and the message creation time in the target is how long copy took

## Sampling Advisories

Advisories are created for sampled streams as described in [Copying Samples of Data](../configuration/sampling). Read on for full detail about those advisories.

Advisories are published to the NATS Server hosting the Source Stream. These advisories could be stored in a Stream and that Stream can also be replicated elsewhere - allowing a large shared real time view of an entire multi location fleet to be build.

When Advisories are published to a Stream one can configure them to be Reliable meaning each message will be tried 10 times on a Backoff policy.  Still does not ensure they are 100% reliable but does make them weather short outages.

Advisories should therefor not be the only way you use to calculate expiring nodes but to augment another system giving it an insight it could not otherwise have if it was build using Sampled data.

### Advisory Schema

Every advisory message has a `protocol` key with the value `io.choria.sr.v2.age_advisory`. This indicates the schema for this message is [https://choria.io/schemas/sr/v2/age_advisory.json](https://choria.io/schemas/sr/v2/age_advisory.json).

### Advisory Details

Each advisory looks like this:

```json
{
  "protocol": "io.choria.sr.v2.age_advisory",
  "event_id": "26QSY17sb9aJL6UPPG6MLOVjIrE",
  "inspect_field": "sender",
  "age": 3600,
  "seen": 1647351430,
  "replicator": "US-EAST",
  "timestamp": 1647355030,
  "event": "timeout",
  "value": "some.host.example.net"
}
```

|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `protocol`      | Constant indicating the schema                                                                                     |
| `event_id`      | A unique correlation ID per event, k-sortable                                                                      |
| `inspect_field` | The key being inspected in the data that caused the advisory                                                       |
| `age`           | The time since this sender last checked in, seconds                                                                |
| `seen`          | Unix time in UTC this sender was last seen                                                                         |
| `replicator`    | A unique indicator of the stream replicator where this advisory originated from. `name` in the main config section |
| `timestamp`     | The time this advisory was generated.  Unix timestamp in UTC                                                       |
| `event`         | The type of advisory. `new`, `timeout`, `recover` or `expire`                                                      |
| `value`         | The value found in the sent data that identifies the unique sender                                                 |

## Inspecting Run-time Data

The `stream-replicator` command comes with a number of tools to inspect the state and behavior of the system. Most of these
will only make sense when deployed clustered or when data sampling is enabled.

{{% notice style="tip" %}}
Some of these commands connect to NATS. You need a configuration context that can be created using `nats context`, this command accept `--context` or will use the selected context.

To connect to Choria Brokers in Organization Issuer mode pass `--choria-jwt` and `--choria-seed` with your Choria tokens. 
{{% /notice %}}


### Searching Advisories

When sampling the Replicator will publish advisories about node states. If you store these in a stream by ingesting `choria.registration.advisories.>`
you can search for a specific or just view all data:

```nohighlight
$ stream-replicator admin advisories REGISTRATION_ADVISORIES node1.example.net --since 5h
Searching 17185 messages for advisories related to node1.example.net

[2023-01-11 12:41:37]     new node1.example.net seen 0s earlier on US_EAST_1
[2023-01-11 12:52:39] timeout node1.example.net seen 11m2s earlier on US_EAST_1
[2023-01-11 12:52:40]  expire node1.example.net seen 11m3s earlier on US_EAST_1
```

### Viewing the state

The above advisories are built by tracking unique values seen in messages, you can view the state store:

```nohighlight
$ sudo stream-replicator admin state /var/lib/stream-replicator node1.example.net
/var/lib/stream-replicator/CHORIA_REGISTRATION_US_EAST_1_4.json:

           Value: node1.example.net
       Seen Time: 2023-01-11 12:47:31.714555561 +0000 UTC (18s)
     Copied Time: 2023-01-11 12:47:31.721943055 +0000 UTC (18s)
    Payload Size: 13916
         Advised: false
```

### Viewing cluster sync gossip

When deploying the replicator in a cluster it will sync the state shown above using a gossip protocol, you can observe
this in real time:

```nohighlight
$ stream-replicator admin gossip
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_4] size: 22272 advised: false: copied: 34m59.985s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_3] size: 6567 advised: false: copied: 19m59.986s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_2] size: 6668 advised: false: copied: 29m59.994s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_2] size: 6748 advised: false: copied: 24m59.992s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_3] size: 7119 advised: false: copied: 49m59.998s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_3] size: 6748 advised: false: copied: 24m59.993s xx.example.net
[CHORIA_REGISTRATION.US_EAST_1_3] size: 6785 advised: false: copied: 29m59.989s xx.example.net
```

## End to End latency monitoring

To facilitate monitoring the latency from the point where a message was added to the source stream till it lands in the target one can look at the
`Choria-SR-Source` header and compare it with the message time in the destination stream.

But what if you have a stream that is not seeing regular traffic? Stream Replicator can publish heartbeats into any subject to cause
traffic to be produced thus facilitating continues monitoring, even on otherwise idle streams.

{{% notice secondary "Version Hint" code-branch %}}
This requires version 0.8.0 of Stream Replicator
{{% /notice %}}

Heartbeats can be published to arbitrary subjects by adding the following configuration.

```yaml
heartbeats:
  interval: 10s
  url: nats://broker.choria.local:4222
  leader_election: false

  # tls:
  #   ca: /path/to/ca.pem
  #   cert: /path/to/cert.pem
  #   key: /path/to/key.pem
  
  choria:
    seed_file: /etc/stream-replicator/credentials/choria.seed
    jwt_file: /etc/stream-replicator/credentials/choria.jwt
    collective: choria

  headers:
    from: choria_compose

  subjects:
    - subject: choria.node_metadata._monitor
    - subject: example._monitor
      interval: 20s
      headers:
        noop: "true"
```

Here we enable heartbeats to two subjects, the `choria.node_metadata._monitor` subject will get messages every 10 seconds
with the `from` header added.

The `example._monitor` subject will get messages every 20 seconds and have both the `from` and `noop` headers.

The connection will be to a Choria Broker based on the `choria` configuration, an alternature traditional TLS connection
is shown in addition.

For high availability one can enable `leader_election` where a specific replicator in a cluster of replicators will be
elected as the one publishing metrics.

The messages being published will have a unix timestamp as body and headers `Choria-SR-Originator` indicating the host
that published the heartbeat by hostname and `Choria-SR-Subject` indicating the subject it was published to.

Using `nats` CLI version `0.0.36` and newer can be used to monitor these messages arrive as planned:

```nohighlight
$ nats server check message --stream CHORIA_REGISTRATION --subject choria.node_metadata._monitor --body-timestamp
OK Stream Message OK:Valid message on CHORIA_REGISTRATION > choria.node_metadata._monitor | age=8.0830s size=10B
```

The command has various flags for monitoring the age, see `--help`.
