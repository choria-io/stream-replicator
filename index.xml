Debian is not supported at present.
YUM Repository For RPMs we publish releases but also nightly builds to our repositories.
Users of our Puppet modules will already have these repositories available.

If you just want to duplicate/combine streams in the same NATS Server Cluster you should probably use a JetStream Source which Choria Broker also supports.
Review the sub-sections for scenario specific details.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/stream-replicator/monitoring/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/stream-replicator/monitoring/index.html</guid><description>Sampling Advisories Advisories are created for sampled streams as described in Copying Samples of Data. Read on for full detail about those advisories.
Advisories are published to the NATS Server hosting the Source Stream. These advisories could be stored in a Stream and that Stream can also be replicated elsewhere - allowing a large shared real time view of an entire multi location fleet to be build.
When Advisories are published to a Stream one can configure them to be Reliable meaning each message will be tried 10 times on a Backoff policy.</description></item></channel></rss>
